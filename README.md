# Nova Verba - Backend

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

This is the backend repository for Nova Verba, an innovative app designed to improve English language skills by recommending new words to users every single day. The app utilizes a Node.js backend with Express, MongoDB for the database, and Vercel for hosting. It also integrates with Firebase, enabling users to log in using their Google accounts.

The primary purpose of this repository is to handle all backend functionalities related to user management, word recommendation, and user word tracking. It leverages a free dictionary API, [DictionaryAPI](https://api.dictionaryapi.dev/api/v2/entries/en/), to search for new words and stores their meanings in the MongoDB database.
